Three.js City Car Driving
=========================

Hi there, this is my first attempt to create an interactive 3D world using Three.js, during the prototyping phase I ended up coding an experimental framework that runs on top of Three.js called `T3` (the code is partially documented).

Want to see the demo? Check it out!   --   [Demo](http://mauriciopoppe.github.io/Three.js-City/T3/)

The project consists of two folders, all the common files are in the folder `boilerplate` and the application is in `T3`.

## Features
- You can drive the car using the WASD keys (you can also turn on its engine using the panel on the right)
- Some properties world and its objects can be updated in runtime using the panel on the top right corner (thanks to dat.gui)
- A random city is generated each time using a simple grid and some boxes with textures
- *Rain* can be enabled using the panel on the top right corner of the document (raindrops have a random initial velocity and follow the car at all times, each time a raindrop's y coordinate is below 0 it goes to the top to avoid creating more particles during runtime)
- (Chrome only) There are two *motion detection* systems that allow you to drive the car only with your movements, one uses [headtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr/) and the other uses a simple technique that detects the number of pixels that changed between frames and according to that moves right or left. (I learned this from: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/javascript-motion-detection.html)
- The texture of the body of the car can be updated in runtime to be a *cubemap texture* (*cough* dropping the fps but allowing reflections)
- The shader "radial blur" is applied as a postprocessing filter to the scene when the car speed is very high (make sure the car is going fast)
- Have you found a position for the camera that you want to save even if you refresh the page? Don't worry! Just click `Add Camera` and its position will be pushed to the camera queue and will be restored even if you refresh the page (thanks to `localstorage`)
- (Chrome only) There's some electronic ambient music (hope you like it!, it's the song used in the game GRITS: http://gritsgame.appspot.com/) that changes the strength of the radial blur in runtime :) just make sure the car is going fast to watch it in action. (NOTE: Since this feature analizes the song loaded in runtime you can change it! Add your favorite song to: `/T3/sounds` and change its reference in the file `/T3/js/Application.js`)

[`/T3/js/Application.js`]

    T3.SoundLoader
            ...
        .addToLoadQueue('sounds/[name of your song here]', 'music-1');

## Browser support

I've tested this project in Google Chrome (v 27.0.1453.116) rendering [35 ~ 45] fps, Google Chrome Canary (v 29.0.1521.0) rendering [30 ~ 36] fps and Firefox (v 19.0.2) rendering [20 ~ 30] fps, all the test were done in a Retina MacBook Pro with the following gpu: `NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1GB`

## Development process
Clone the project to see the development process step by step using git's tag system, i.e. `git checkout r3`, `git checkout r4`, etc.

## How to launch the project
- Set up a web server in the root of this project and goto `/T3/index.html` in you browser
